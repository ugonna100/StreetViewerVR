# StreetViewerVR
HackGSU StreetViewerVR App

This project provides a video service to Google StreetView. Sometimes the best way to truly understand a trip is to see it for yourself.
Google StreetView provides a good method for viewing individual spots on a journey but has no system that allows you to play the whole trip.
VR compatible, this application attempts to make the experience of traveling by car as realistic as possible. Short of the vibrations of the
road, bugs on the windshield and strange smells; you'll feel like your really there.
